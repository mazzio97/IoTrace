        \begin{description}[Pos. Providers]
            \item[Users] Each person using actively the application. 
            \item[Diagnosticians] GPs that verify whether the user is the rightful holder of pseudonyms and sign positive cases.
            \item[GeoSolvers] Servers which compute risks and update notifications for the users.
            \item[Authorities] Governments or other authorities which provide authorizations and keys.
            \item[Pos. Providers] GNSS, Bluetooth, Cellular Towers, and WiFi, used to certificate new users as well

    \begin{block}{Privacy}
        Privacy is guaranteed by design enabling only authorized entities to see the information strictly related to their duty.

    \begin{block}{Blockchain}
        Solution based on two DLTs, the \textbf{notification} one and the \textbf{tracing} one.
        Consensus mechanism represents a crucial decision, they opted for a DAG-based solution. Contact tracing can be seen as a special case of Internet of Things.
