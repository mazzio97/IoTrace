\begin{block}{Why a Simulator?}
    In order to \textbf{show} a possible (small scale) \textbf{real world scenario} of the application and display the macroscopic interactions between the multiple entities.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Customization}
    It is possible to \textbf{configure} almost \textbf{every detail} of the simulation, for instance:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Number of agents involved
        \item Pace of the simulation clock
        \item Infection probability
        \item Publish frequency of the agents
    \end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Uniqueness} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Any two simulation runs are \textbf{independent}. 
        \item Any simulation has a \textbf{unique seed} from which the simulation is generated. All the \textbf{MAM channels} involved in the simulation are \textbf{generated using} this \textbf{seed}.
        \item Running a new simulation \textbf{without changing} the \textbf{seed} results in \textbf{unpredictable results} due to multiple writings at the same address.
    \end{itemize}
\end{block}
