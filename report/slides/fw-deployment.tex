\begin{block}{IoT Context}
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item We developed a \textbf{simulator} since we did not have the possibility to run tests in a real world context
        \item A real-word application should be deployed for mobile devices
        \begin{itemize}
            \item [$\Rightarrow$] the "\textbf{back-end}" part for this application can be easily adapted from our code
            \item [$\Rightarrow$] the simulator should only be used for regression tests
            \item [$\Rightarrow$] the "\textbf{front-end}" must use device sensors API 
            \item [$\Rightarrow$] Some suitable form of \textbf{pub/sub} mechanism for IoT (e.g. MQTT)
        \end{itemize} 
    \end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Scalability Issues}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Our simulation runs on a single computer
        \item We managed to simulate concurrency through multiple threads
        \item We could not consider possible scalability issues regarding computation, memory consumption and throughput, problems also present in the original paper
    \end{itemize}
